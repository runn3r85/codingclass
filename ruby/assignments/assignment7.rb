# Due Friday March 27th 

# Build a contacts app using THREE classes 
# just like assignment 6. HOWEVER, you must
# have tests for each of the classes.

# The file structure should look like:
# Folder: assignment7
#   > address_book.rb
#   > contact.rb
#   > number.rb
#   Folder: spec
#     > address_book_spec.rb
#     > contact_spec.rb
#     > number_spec.rb
#     > test_spec.rb (copied from project 3)
